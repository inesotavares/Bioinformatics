# Sequence Alignment Algorithms
## Project Overview

This project explores global and local sequence alignment algorithms to compare pairs of DNA sequences. The assignment involves computing alignment matrices, identifying optimal alignments, and implementing a test function to automate the alignment process using Python.

Two main algorithms are applied:

- Global Alignment (Needleman–Wunsch) – aligns sequences over their entire length.
- Local Alignment (Smith–Waterman) – finds the most similar subsequences within larger sequences.

## Objectives
- Construct score and traceback matrices for both global and local alignments.
- Identify the best alignment score and retrieve the optimal aligned sequences.
- Explore whether multiple optimal alignments exist for each pair.
- Implement and test a Python function to automate the alignment workflow.
