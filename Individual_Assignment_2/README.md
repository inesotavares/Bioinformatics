# Position Weight Matrix (PWM) Implementation
## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Python class for Position Weight Matrices (PWMs), a fundamental concept in bioinformatics used to represent motifs in biological sequences (DNA, RNA, or proteins).

The assignment involves implementing a PWM class with various methods to calculate frequencies, information content, consensus sequences, and log-odds scores, as well as to scan target sequences for motif matches.

This exercise combines object-oriented programming (OOP) with computational biology concepts, reflecting a practical approach to motif discovery and scoring.

## Objectives

- Implement a fully functional PWM class to represent motifs.

- Define core attributes including the motif list, sequence type, alphabet, and PWM matrix.

- Implement methods to handle:
  - Pseudo-count addition
  - PWM printing and consensus derivation
  - Information content calculation
  - Motif scoring on sequences
  - Matrix updates and log-odds computation

- Develop a test function that demonstrates all class functionalities in a standalone Python file.
